# Food Recipe Project

The food recipe project is a frontend application built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Context API, and React Router. The main features of the project include:

- **Recipe Search**: Users can search for recipes by entering ingredients or dish names. The application fetches relevant recipes from the Forkify API and displays them.
- **Recipe Detail Display**: Clicking on a recipe shows detailed information, including ingredients, servings, cooking time, and an image of the dish.
- **Favorites Management**: Users can add recipes to their favorites list or remove them from it.
- **Global State Management**: The application uses the Context API to manage global state, such as search parameters, recipe lists, recipe details, and the favorites list, ensuring consistency across different pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS is used to create a responsive layout, ensuring the application looks good on various devices.
